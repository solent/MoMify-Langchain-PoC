In this app, you can upload a video in order to extract text transcription and summary from it.
This application is running locally (no external services called) and uses under the hood : 
- Whisper to transcript video ;
- LangChain as the glue ;
- Mistral as the LLM engine ;

You can try it out directly, or have a look at the source code here : [github.com/ThomasVuillaume/langchain-transcript](https://github.com/ThomasVuillaume/langchain-transcript).
